Side Project #1

A work in progress.....using some art from an unfinished comic I drew a few years....I"m going to try and use HTML, CSS, & JavaScript to make a fully working website for the comic. Not intention of finishing that comic itself, but with a fully working template, I could easily apply and rework this site for other comics.

It would have a side navigation bar 

A home page with the comics current page, as well as a seperate news blurp either above or below the comic to notify reader with updates to the comic.

An Archive page where you can navigate thru the comic

A Character Page with short bios explaining the character

A FAQ page where I try to answer some questions...this page will also double as the contact page.
