          This here is Shamus! The most atypical of all Leprechauns, he owns and runs a shoe shop in the main lep city
          and spends most of his free time getting drunk off Guinness with his mates. Unlike most other Leps, Shamus is
          not skilled at all in the magical arts, but he makes up for his magical shortcomings with courage, dedication,
          and having the purest of all hearts.

          This here is Finn, Shamus's older brother. Very critical of Shamus, Finn has a knack for not taking shit from anyone, especially his brother. Deeply conservative, Finn is at the heart of keeping Shamus on the path all leps should live.
